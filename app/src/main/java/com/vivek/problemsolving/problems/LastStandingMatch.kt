/*
Last Standing Match
You are given a string of characters, where each character is a player.
Reduce the players to one player based on the following rules:

* Each round the starts from the first player on the string.
* On a playerâ€™s turn, the immediate next player is knocked out (KO) and then the turn goes to the next position.
* We continue until all players have taken a turn and then start the next round.
* Rounds continue until there is only 1 player left.
Example:
* AB the winner is A
* ABC the winner is C
    * Round 1 Turn 1, A will KO B which will result AC
    * Round 1 Turn 2, C will KO A because it's C turn
    * C is the winner
* ABCD the winner is A
    * Round 1 Turn 1, A will KO B which will result ACD
    * Round 1 Turn 2, C will KO D which will result AC
    * Round 2 Turn 1, A will KO C which result A
